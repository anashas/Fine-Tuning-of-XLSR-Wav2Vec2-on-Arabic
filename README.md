# Fine-Tuning-of-XLSR-Wav2Vec2-on-Arabic

- This repository is part of my participation in Hugging Face Fine Tuning week of XLRS Wav2Vec2 on Common Voice Corpus 4 Arabic dataset.

- The [mini_arabic.ipynb](https://github.com/anashas/Fine-Tuning-of-XLSR-Wav2Vec2-on-Arabic/blob/main/mini_arabic.ipynb) notebook contains all data preprocessing and training steps.

- The [evaluation.ipynb](https://github.com/anashas/Fine-Tuning-of-XLSR-Wav2Vec2-on-Arabic/blob/main/evaluation.ipynb) notebook contains testing steps.
